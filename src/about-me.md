# About me

Hi, I’m Mishaun and I’m glad you landed here!

It is my goal to help you discover how you can better care for yourself and pull forth the health goals you’ve been holding onto. For me, lifestyle changes were the catalyst for an ever-evolving health journey. My path to health has been windy. Fortunately, each bend revealed a new insight, every incline offered a unique challenge, and the straightaways allowed me to enjoy the journey. If this is something that resonates with you, I'd love to be your partner, cheerleader, and educator in getting started, or as you continue along your path.

As a Functional Medicine Health Coach, I understand the interconnectedness of the different lifestyle behaviors that support or diminish our health, and I’m skilled in helping people identify, design, and implement change that will move them towards the picture of health they hold in their minds. I’d like to help you do this too!

## My Background

First, let me share a bit about me and how I got into the field of functional medicine health coaching. My interest started as I watched my dad struggle with his own health problems as I was growing up. I spent a lot of my free time researching what I could about natural healing and stumbled upon functional medicine, but it would be about 10 years and a few careers before I would dive into more formal education. While I was busy self-studying functional medicine I was moonlighting in a few other professions that actually strengthened my resolve as a health coach. As a high school Language Arts teacher I learned to meet people where they are at, to care enough to understand their whole story, and to be the support they needed to reach their goals. As a UX Researcher, I learned how to be curious with the end goal of understanding, how to dig deep and expose the root problems to be solved. While I was passionate about many aspects of these two careers my unwavering interest was in the human body, mind, and spirit and how to harmonize those three aspects of the human condition.

My knowledge expanded while becoming a Certified Functional Medicine Health Coach through the Functional Medicine Health Coaching Academy where I spent the year learning from many brilliant voices in the field such as Dr. Mark Hyman, Dr. Kristi Hughes, Dr. Tom O’Bryan, and Dr. Deanna Minich, and I began to integrate the lessons from my careers and my education to inform how I work with clients. In devotion to my love of working with people on their health goals, I spend a lot of time continuing my education so my craft never becomes stagnant and outdated. In addition to my continued education in functional medicine, I also engage in education dedicated to equity and justice in the health and wellness field.

It was through my studies and self-experimentation that I came to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to healing and that every person is unique so bio-individualized support is necessary for a successful healing approach.

My goal as a coach is to help you find alignment in all areas of your life that you find important so you can be the best version of yourself.

As we work together, I am committed to collaborating on the best approach to ensuring you reach your goals while simultaneously finding ways to make it enjoyable.
