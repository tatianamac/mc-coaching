## One on One Health Coaching

Everyone’s unique so why should our health journeys look the same?

We all need to engage in similar lifestyle factors in order to flourish– movement, rest, nourishment, relaxation, connection; however, there is no one-size-fits all approach to help us get there. Each person’s path meanders differently, and if you need help establishing yours, I’d love to support.

As we chart your course we will take into account your personal health history, your lifestyle and the habits that will support it, and what your individual preferences are. As a functional medicine health coach, we will approach this work holistically which means looking at how the different lifestyle factors impact each other and show up in your life.

**I would love to work with you if...**

- You are tired and have low energy throughout the day
- Your sleep pattern is impacted
- You’re looking for ways to manage your stress
