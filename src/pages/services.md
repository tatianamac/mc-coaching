## One-on-One Health Coaching

Everyone’s unique so why should our health journeys look the same?

We all need to engage in similar lifestyle factors in order to flourish– movement, rest, nourishment, relaxation, connection; however, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to help us get there. Each person’s path meanders differently, and if you need help establishing yours, I’d love to support.

As we chart your course we will take into account your personal health history, your lifestyle and the habits that will support it, and what your individual preferences are. As a functional medicine health coach, we will approach this work holistically which means looking at how the different lifestyle factors impact each other and show up in your life.

**I would love to work with you if...**

* You are tired and have low energy throughout the day
* Your sleep pattern is impacted
* You’re looking for ways to manage your stress
* You exercise all the time but aren't seeing results
* You feel like food is choosing you and you aren’t choosing your food
* You're overwhelmed by all the information on health and wellness and want clarity
* You're currently working with a healthcare practitioner, but are completely overwhelmed
* You have habits you want to ditch and new ones you want to create
* You want to feel good on the inside 
* You are ready to take action, prioritize yourself, and have an open mind

## What does one on one health coaching entail?
  
* An initial deep dive consultation where we will discuss personal health history, current lifestyle, and goals 

* Follow-up sessions with focused action steps–cadence agreed upon by coach and client

* Frequent support and motivational check-ins
  
* Lifestyle and behavioral suggestions (with your permission!) aligned with personal goals 
  
* Educational resources as requested
  
* A new member of your care team who will help you identify the vision for your health and find empowerment in your healing journey by supporting you to take the steps to harmonize your body, mind, and spirit
