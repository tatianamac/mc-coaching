## Question category

### What does a health coach do?

Health coaches partner with clients who seek to enhance their well-being through self-directed, lasting changes that are in alignment with their values. Health coaches work with clients to understand their unique needs and health goals in order to co-create individualized food and lifestyle plans to meet these needs. We recognize and understand that the client is an expert on their own life, which sets the stage for respectful and non-judgmental interactions.

This work includes but is not limited to:

* Nurturing a positive relationship with the client that empowers you to make lasting changes for better health and well-being
* Offering clients support, accountability, collaboration, education, and resources
* Translating a practitioner’s plan of care into a plan of action
* Assisting with dietary changes, food plans, and physical activity protocols

### What is functional medicine?

Functional Medicine is a systems biology-based approach which aims to restore health and promote optimal wellness by looking beyond the treatment of syptoms and instead addressing the underlying cause of disease. The functional medicine model requires a deep understanding of each patient’s genetic, biochemical, and lifestyle factors and leverages that information to direct personalized treatment plans that lead to improved and sustainable health outcomes. This approach fosters collaboration between patients, doctors, and health coaches in order to resolve the complex underlying causes of disease and restore health through diet and lifestyle change.

### Do I need a primary care physician if I’m seeing a health coach?

Yes! You will still want to see your primary care physician at your recommended cadence. With your permission, a health coach can also work closely with your doctor to understand your health goals in order to co-create a plan with you to meet those goals.

A health coach is *not* a doctor. We *do not* diagnose, treat or prescribe. Instead, we are an added member of your health team who works with you to understand imbalances, and then we support you in restoring wellness. Health Coaches aim to restore a person’s health as a whole, which means looking at all lifestyle behaviors and not just food. We also consider movement or exercise, stress relief, proper rest, emotional well being, relationships, life meaning and purpose, mind-body connection, and spiritual practice. 

### How does positive psychology help?

Positive psychology is the scientific study of the strengths that enable individuals and communities to thrive. Positive psychology is used in health coaching because it is founded on the belief that people want to lead meaningful and fulfilling lives, to cultivate what is best within themselves, and to enhance their experiences of love, work, and play which is supportive in achieving sustainable lifestyle changes.

### **Why is the first consultation so much longer than the following consultations?**

The first time we meet we’ll take time to understand the several aspects that make you, you. I will conduct a thorough health history to understand your past. Then we’ll explore where you are currently at on your social, emotional, spiritual, physical, and nutritional path. We’ll then get clear on your intention and level of willingness to make changes. From there we will co-create a health and wellness plan. Each follow up meeting will range from XX-XX minutes. 

### How quickly will I see results?

Reults depend on several factors, including the specific goal, your commitment and adherence level, and your own bioindividuality. All of our bodies are unique (as well as our minds and spirits) which means we all react differently to change. 

### What is your race and sexual orientation?

I am a cis-gendered hetero white woman. I am doing the work to acknowledge my privilege and support anti-racist, inclusive agendas and recognize I always have more work to do here. I understand that working with a coach who matches your life experiences can be very helpful, and I would be happy to refer you to a coach who closely matches yours.
