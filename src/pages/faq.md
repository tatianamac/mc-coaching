## Question category

### What does a health coach do?

Health coaches partner with clients who want to heal through self-directed, sustainable change that aligns with their values. We work with clients to understand their unique needs and health goals in order to co-create individualized food and lifestyle plans to meet these needs. We understand that the client is the expert of their own life, which sets the stage for respectful and non-judgmental interactions.

This work includes but is not limited to:

* Nurturing a positive relationship that empowers you to make lasting change for better health and well-being
* Offering support, accountability, collaboration, education, and resources
* Translating a practitioner’s plan of care into a plan of action
* Assisting with dietary changes, food plans, physical activity protocols, stress management, and fostering spiritual and community connection

### What is functional medicine?

Functional Medicine is a systems biology-based approach that aims to restore health and promote optimal wellness by looking beyond the treatment of symptoms and instead addressing the underlying cause of disease. The functional medicine model requires a deep understanding of each patient’s genetic, biochemical, and lifestyle factors and leverages that information to direct personalized treatment plans that lead to improved and sustainable health outcomes. This approach fosters collaboration between patients, doctors, and health coaches in order to resolve the complex underlying causes of disease and restore health through diet and lifestyle change.

### Do I need a primary care physician if I’m seeing a health coach?

Yes! You will still want to see your primary care physician at your recommended cadence. With your permission, a health coach can also work closely with your doctor to understand your health plan to help you turn it into a plan of action.

A health coach is *not* a doctor. We *do not* diagnose, treat, or prescribe. Instead, we are an added member of your care team who works with you to understand imbalances, and then we support you in restoring wellness. We aim to restore a person’s health as a whole, which means looking at all lifestyle behaviors and not only food. We also take into consideration movement, stress relief, proper rest, emotional well being, relationships, life meaning and purpose, mind-body connection, and spiritual practice. 

### How does positive psychology help?

Positive psychology is the scientific study of strengths that empower individuals and communities to thrive. It is used in health coaching because it is founded on the belief that people want to lead meaningful and fulfilling lives, to cultivate what is best within themselves, and to enhance their experiences of love, work, and play which is supportive in achieving sustainable lifestyle changes.

### **Why is the first session so much longer than the following consultations?**

The first time we meet we’ll take time to understand the several aspects that make you, you. I will conduct a thorough health history to understand your past. Then we’ll explore where you are currently at on your social, emotional, spiritual, physical, and nutritional path. We’ll then get clear on your intention and level of willingness to make changes. From there we will co-create a health and wellness plan. Each follow-up meeting will range from XX-XX minutes. 

### How quickly will I see results?

Results depend on several factors, including the specific goal, your commitment and adherence level, and your own bio-individuality. All of our bodies are unique (as well as our minds and spirits) which means we all react differently to change. 

### What is your race and sexual orientation?

I am a cis-gendered hetero white woman. I am doing the work to acknowledge my privilege and support anti-racist, inclusive agendas, and recognize I always have more work to do here. I understand that working with a coach who matches your life experiences can be very helpful, and I would be happy to refer you to a coach who closely matches yours if I'm not the right fit.
